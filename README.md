##Libraries

What I used so that new installations won't disturb my system :
You can create an virtual environment, where all necessary library will be. 

macOS/Linux

    python3 -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate

Windows

    python -m venv myenv
    myenv\Scripts\activate

You can install via pip all needed libraries you may miss.
The say needed libraries are called in the file IMPORTS.
